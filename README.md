## Usage

make sure you have python and java installed on your system

python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

java: https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

if this is your first time using python, make sure to install these modules:

```pip install requests```
requests is for fetching json

```pip install tqdm``` 
tqdm is just for fancy loading screen on the command prompt

1. download or just copy paste entire code from ```mindustry-be-updater.py``` on the repo.

2. ran the script by clicking twice on it or using cmd by running ```python mindustry-be-updater.py```
